# Some-Pattern-Recognition-Methods-Implementation
I think our Pattern Recognition Class's homework is quite interesting, so I place my code here for sharing, please check.

Experiment 1 and experiment 2 used the dataset of mnist downloaded here http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ .

## Experiment 1
We are required to implete PCA for decomposition the image from minist and then implete a Bayes Classifier for classification. See how the dimension of the decomposed data and the independence between dimensions may affect the accuracy of classification.

The original slide in Chinese is here.





## Experiment 2
We are required to implete a Perceptron for classify any two of the ten digits from the projected data (After PCA). 

The original slide in Chinese is here.
